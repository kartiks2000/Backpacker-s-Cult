# Backpacker-s-Cult
Designed and Developed by Kartik Saxena

Being a enthusiast of the backpackers concept and dreaming for a day to grab a backpack and leave to travel the world leaving everything behind.... 
i have designed and developed a dummy website to inspire others and aware others about this concept.

concepts/features of this project -:
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) "FLEXBOX" for layouts
4) Video clips as a background
5) Embeded video player
6) Mobile first approach
7) yet it works perfectly with other devices as well (responsive)
8) desing gives out a cool vibe to the user


NOTE -:
Although its not adviced to use a looping background video as it makes rendering a website slow, but still i did it intentionally because of the vibes and superb look & feel to it.


hope u guys feel it too.....
